🔬 Overview:  
This repository secures the Quantum Cancer Treatment framework, integrating **quantum bioenergetics, metabolic reprogramming, ECS-driven immune modulation, and AI-driven precision oncology.  

Cancer isn’t just a genetic disease—it’s a quantum metabolic disorder. Tumors exploit cryptic functional sequences, proton spin, and metabolic adaptation to survive.  

This dataset destroys cancer’s survival mechanisms at the quantum level** and replaces outdated chemo and radiation with real regenerative healing.  

🔥 Why This Matters:  
✅ First Quantum Cancer Treatment Dataset – Mapping tumour bioenergetics, vibrational tumor disruption, and metabolic stress cycling.  
✅ Cancer Eradication Without Chemo – Quantum-tuned immune checkpoints, ECS-mediated apoptosis, and mitochondrial reprogramming.  
✅ AI-Driven Personalized Oncology – Using AI & Quantum Medicine to design real-time cancer reversal protocols.**
